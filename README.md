# JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript (or JS) is a fully-featured programming language. It is today one of the most
popular languages used for the development of web applications, and also for a lot of
different programs.

It's a great second language to learn, as it introduces many new language concepts not
found in languages such as Ruby. It will also let you reinforce concepts you've already
learned.

In this module, you'll learn the basics of Javascript by pairing through a series of
exercises, either building on previous knowledge or discovering new concepts. You'll then
build a more complex coding challenge using all of those new concepts.

## Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking
  programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Outline

### Phase Two

Work through challenges designed to help you learn how to use JavaScript in a real
application, including unit tests, multiple classes, and external dependencies on
packages and remote APIs.

1. [Testing with Jest](./challenges/01_testing.md)
2. [A Search function](./challenges/02_search_function.md)
3. [A Shopping basket](./challenges/03_shopping_basket.md)
4. [A Thermostat](./challenges/04_thermostat.md)
5. [A Pokédex](./challenges/05_calling_apis.md)
6. [A Weather client](./challenges/06_weather_api.md)
7. [A Web server](./challenges/07_web_server.md)

Most people won't complete all of this and that is OK.
